## Hi RoR!
Hi, this is all about **Getting Started with Rails** From [rubyOnRails.org](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html) 👌

Yes. Why I love Ruby on Rails Rails is - It's powerful framework that can help you become more productive and confident, when working on complex projects.

🐱‍🏍 Why is Rails used?
The biggest advantage to Rails is that it makes web development quick and easy. 
This means a small team of developers can create a web app and deploy it quickly. 
The Ruby programming language ecosystem also provides libraries that can extend 
the Rails framework with even more pre-built features.
🔒 Rails is Reassuringly secure
⛓ Rails is Exceedingly scalable.

and Tinker too, and eventually you may *toss me some feedback* :blush:

Here, the emphasy lies on this motto of the Maker Movement: :art:
```
Learning By Doing!
``` 

I believe that the essential lessons can be learned about the systems - about the world - 
from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interenting things.

These are the [Levy, Steven(2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396)'s **Hackers Ethic** principles (that I've valued most):
* *Access to computer* - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* Always *yield to Hands-on Imperative*!
* *Hackers should be judged by their hacking*, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position;
* You can *create art and beauty* on a computer;
* Computer can *change your life for the better*.
